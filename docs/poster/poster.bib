  abstract = {<p>This paper presents al data-driven techniques and methodologies used to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of a fleet of aircraft engines that can suffer failures of diverse nature. The solution presented is based on two Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) stacked in two levels. The first DCNN is used to extract a low-dimensional feature vector using the normalized raw data as input. The second DCNN ingests a list of vectors taken from the former DCNN and estimates the RUL. Model selection was carried out by means of Bayesian optimization using a repeated random subsampling validation approach. The proposed methodology was ranked in the third place of the 2021 PHM Conference Data Challenge.</p>},

  abstract = {<p>Accurate estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL) is a key component of condition based maintenance (CBM) and prognosis and health management (PHM). Data-based models for the estimation of RUL are of particular interest because expert knowledge of systems is not always available and physical modeling is often not feasible. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is investigated for its ability to estimate the RUL of turbofan engines. The input to the model is a window of time series data collected from the engine under test. Inputting raw sensor data allows features to be learned instead of manually determined. To incorporate the ability to detect features of differing lengths, inception modules are used in the neural network architecture. The model is trained and tested using the new Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (N-CMAPSS) data set and high prognosis accuracy was achieved. The developed model was used in the 2021 PHM Society Data Challenge and received second place, further validating its ability to accurately estimate RUL.</p>},

  abstract = {<p>Remaining useful life (RUL) is the expected remaining operating life of an asset until it can no longer perform its intended function. The 2021 PHM Society Data Challenge posed the problem of estimating the RUL of aircraft engines with various competing failure modes and underlying degradation trajectories. In this work, we describe the approach and solution to the challenge where we map from the multivariate time series sensor readings to the remaining useful life, measured in the remaining number of flight cycles until failure. The proposed solution utilizes a deep convolutional neural network that can take inputs of variable length. Furthermore, we preprocess the data according to a normalization procedure that help reveal the degradation trend that is obfuscated by the continuously varying flight conditions. The normalization procedure involves training a feedforward neural network on a non-degraded subset of the data that maps from the flight conditions to the sensor outputs. The difference between the expected sensor readings and the actual observations is then interpreted as the extent of deviation from normal, i.e., degradation. Finally, we describe the sampling techniques which is designed to reduce the number of non-informative samples fed to the neural network.</p>},
