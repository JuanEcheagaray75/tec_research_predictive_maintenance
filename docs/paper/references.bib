  abstract = {<p>A key enabler of intelligent maintenance systems is the ability to predict the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of its components, i.e., prognostics. The development of data-driven prognostics models requires datasets with run-to-failure trajectories. However, large representative run-to-failure datasets are often unavailable in real applications because failures are rare in many safety-critical systems. To foster the development of prognostics methods, we develop a new realistic dataset of run-to-failure trajectories for a fleet of aircraft engines under real flight conditions. The dataset was generated with the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (CMAPSS) model developed at NASA. The damage propagation modelling used in this dataset builds on the modelling strategy from previous work and incorporates two new levels of fidelity. First, it considers real flight conditions as recorded on board of a commercial jet. Second, it extends the degradation modelling by relating the degradation process to its operation history. This dataset also provides the health, respectively, fault class. Therefore, besides its applicability to prognostics problems, the dataset can be used for fault diagnostics.</p>},

Data-based models for the estimation of RUL are of particular interest because expert knowledge of systems is not always available and physical modeling is often not feasible. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is investigated for its ability to estimate the RUL of turbofan engines. The input to the model is a window of time series data collected from the engine under test. Inputting raw sensor data allows features to be learned instead of manually determined. To incorporate the ability to detect features of differing lengths, inception modules are used in the neural network architecture. The model is trained and tested using the new Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (N-CMAPSS) data set and high prognosis accuracy was achieved. The developed model was used in the 2021 PHM Society Data Challenge and received second place, further validating its ability to accurately estimate RUL.</p>},

@article{Achouch2022,
  abstract = {<p>In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, several concepts have arisen in parallel with this new revolution, such as predictive maintenance, which today plays a key role in sustainable manufacturing and production systems by introducing a digital version of machine maintenance. The data extracted from production processes have increased exponentially due to the proliferation of sensing technologies. Even if Maintenance 4.0 faces organizational, financial, or even data source and machine repair challenges, it remains a strong point for the companies that use it. Indeed, it allows for minimizing machine downtime and associated costs, maximizing the life cycle of the machine, and improving the quality and cadence of production. This approach is generally characterized by a very precise workflow, starting with project understanding and data collection and ending with the decision-making phase. This paper presents an exhaustive literature review of methods and applied tools for intelligent predictive maintenance models in Industry 4.0 by identifying and categorizing the life cycle of maintenance projects and the challenges encountered, and presents the models associated with this type of maintenance: condition-based maintenance (CBM), prognostics and health management (PHM), and remaining useful life (RUL). Finally, a novel applied industrial workflow of predictive maintenance is presented including the decision support phase wherein a recommendation for a predictive maintenance platform is presented. This platform ensures the management and fluid data communication between equipment throughout their life cycle in the context of smart maintenance.</p>},

The 2021 PHM Society Data Challenge posed the problem of estimating the RUL of aircraft engines with various competing failure modes and underlying degradation trajectories. In this work, we describe the approach and solution to the challenge where we map from the multivariate time series sensor readings to the remaining useful life, measured in the remaining number of flight cycles until failure. The proposed solution utilizes a deep convolutional neural network that can take inputs of variable length. Furthermore, we preprocess the data according to a normalization procedure that help reveal the degradation trend that is obfuscated by the continuously varying flight conditions. The normalization procedure involves training a feedforward neural network on a non-degraded subset of the data that maps from the flight conditions to the sensor outputs. The difference between the expected sensor readings and the actual observations is then interpreted as the extent of deviation from normal, i.e., degradation. Finally, we describe the sampling techniques which is designed to reduce the number of non-informative samples fed to the neural network.</p>},
